# MKFit
This application will facilitate communication between trainers and  clients, simplifying the tracking progress; our goal is not to replace existing apps like MyFitnessPal, but to complement them. 
By focusing on monitoring BMI, updating progress photos, introducing new workout routines, and maintaining transparency, trainers can easily monitor their clients' exercises, track their progress over time, and make necessary adjustments to their exercise routines.

During the begenning phase of our creating this application, we utilized flutter-flow to create our prototype of what the app will look like and its functions. Below, are the first pages we created based on our clients vision, to showcase what the app would closely look like.   

The following pages were created:
<ul style="circle">
