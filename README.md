# Tonne it Up
This application will facilitate communication between trainers and  clients, simplifying the tracking progress; our goal is not to replace existing apps like MyFitnessPal, but to complement them. 
By focusing on monitoring BMI, updating progress photos, introducing new workout routines, and maintaining transparency, trainers can easily monitor their clients' exercises, track their progress over time, and make necessary adjustments to their exercise routines. Through our work, we strive to satisfy and improve the workout experience for trainer and client.

## Developer Instructions
---
To run this code, developers must download the latest versions of Dart/Flutter and Java, as well as Android Studio.  
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>

<a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart">Dart SDK</a>

<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter SDK</a>

<a href="https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-download">A compatible Java Development Kit.</a>

At the time of this writing, JDK 8 or JDK 11 are compatible with Android Studio.

Upon downloading the project, the developer must setup their SDK manager within Android Studio. To do so, click on "SDK Manager" from the toolbar.  You will need to add a Flutter and Dart framework based upon its downloaded location.

Users must also set their Java Development kit and Java_PATH files in their environmental variables by searching "environment" in your device's search bar and clicking "Environmental Variables." 
In this menu, you must edit the "System Variables" and add a variable named JAVA_HOME.  This variable should point to your JDK 8 or (preferably) JDK 11 folder.

In order to utilize Android Studio's development tools, you must use its built-in emulator.  On the right of the progam, there is an icon named "Device Manager." Through this manager, you will download an emulator for your selected phone.
Testing will be done using this emulator.  You can run it at any time using the trianguar "play" button.

With Android Studio's environment set up properly and the emulator downloaded, you will be able to run the project. Run it using the triangular "play" button on the top bar; if you have an emulator open it will automatically select the device for you.


<b>//---------------MUST WRITE HOW TO DEPLOY THE PRODUCT-------------------\\</b>


## Getting Started
---

The current build of the app is able to run on an Android Phone Emulator using Flutter. With Android Studio, while an emulator device is running, typing "flutter run" into the terminal should build and run the app as long as flutter is correctly installed.
FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.
