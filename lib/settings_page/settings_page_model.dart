Jira Task MA-52. Sub tasks MA - 106, 107, and 108.

For this task, I was in charge of
making sure that all of the buttons within the settings page have functionalities and they are doing
what they're supposed to do. To complete task, I had to create pages such as
change_address and confirm_new_username. The other pages that were already created
so I only needed to creat these two. Within all of the pages located inside the settings page
I added a navigate back function, so whe you clikk on thos pages, you can navigate back to teh settings
page.
